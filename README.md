Basic portfolio site querying github api to display info about current repos. Decided to stray away from JS and have a go at writing some reason-ml with Reason-React

### Todos:

- [ ] diagram of tech used at work
- [ ] show shorter date for 'Last edited' on mobile
- [ ] error handling
- [ ] display a loading state whilst the topics request is waiting to resolve
- [ ] move hard coded info (eg github username) into a config file
